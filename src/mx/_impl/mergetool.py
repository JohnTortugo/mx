            A `git mergetool` to fix mx suite import update conflicts in suite.py files.

            The tool resets all suite import revisions to the LOCAL revisions and thus, resolving the merge conflict.
            After updating the imports (if any), `diff3` is called to resolve the remaining conflicts.

            Note that the tool is only meant to resolve the conflict. It is not guaranteed that the import update
            is semantically correct. For example, the imports in the merged file might be older than the merged-in imports.
            Tools like `mx scheckimports` can be used to fix the imported revisions after the merge.

            To use the mergetool via `git`, add the following entry to your `.gitconfig`:

            [mergetool "mx-suite-import"]
                cmd = mx mergetool-suite-import "$LOCAL" "$BASE" "$REMOTE" "$MERGED"
                trustExitCode = true

            Then, merge conflicts can be resolved as follows:

            $ git merge remote-branch
            Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
            $ git mergetool --tool=mx-suite-import
